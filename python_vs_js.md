| Feature              | JavaScript                                           | Python                                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose & Usage**  | Mainly for web development (front-end & back-end).   | General-purpose: data science, AI, backend, automation. |
| **Syntax**           | Uses `{}` for blocks and often `;` to end statements.| Uses indentation (whitespace) for blocks.         |
| **Typing System**    | Dynamically typed with loose type coercion.          | Dynamically typed, stricter and more predictable. |
| **Runtime**          | Runs in browsers and Node.js.                        | Runs on Python interpreter.                       |
| **OOP Style**        | Prototype-based object orientation.                  | Class-based object orientation.                   |
| **Libraries**        | React, Angular, Vue, Express.js.                     | Django, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas.       |
| **Performance**      | Generally faster in web apps (V8 engine).            | Slower, but strong with optimized libraries.      |
| **Community**        | Strong in web development.                           | Strong in data science, AI, research.             |
