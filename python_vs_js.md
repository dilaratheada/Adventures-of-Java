# JavaScript vs Python

## Features 
Purpose & Usage, Syntax, Typing System, Runtime, OOP Style, Libraries, Performance, Community

## Purpose & Usage
- **JavaScrip** is mainly for website develompent (front-end and back-end),
- **Python**'s general purpose is data science, AI backend and automation. 

## Syntax
- **JavaScrip** uses `{}` for blocks and often `;` to end statements,
- **Python** uses indentation (whitespace) for blocks.

## Typing System
- **JavaScript** is dynamically typed with loose type coercion,
- **Python** is dynamically typed, stricter and more predictable.

## Run Time
- **JavaScript** runs in browsers and Node.js,
- **Python** runs on Python interpreter.

## OOP Style
- **JavaSript** has a prototype-based object orientation,
- **Python** has a class-based object orientation.

## Libraries
- **JavaScript** has React, Angular, Vue, Express.js,
- **Python** has Django, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas.

## Performance
- **JavaScript** is generally faster in web apps (V8 engine),
- **Python** is slower, but strong with optimized libraries.

## Community
- **JavaScript** is strong in web development,
- **Python** is strong in data science, AI, research.
