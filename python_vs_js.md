# JavaScript vs Python

## Features 📌
Purpose & Usage, Syntax, Typing System, Runtime, OOP Style, Libraries, Performance, Community

### Purpose & Usage ✒️
- ***JavaScript*** is mainly for website development (front-end and back-end),
- ***Python***'s general purpose is data science, AI backend, and automation. 

### Syntax 🧾
- ***JavaScrip*** uses `{}` for blocks and often `;` to end statements,
- ***Python*** uses indentation (whitespace) for blocks.

### Typing System 📠
- ***JavaScript*** is dynamically typed with loose type coercion,
- ***Python*** is dynamically typed, stricter, and more predictable.

### Run Time 🏃🏿‍♂️‍➡️
- ***JavaScript*** runs in browsers and Node.js,
- ***Python*** runs on a Python interpreter.

### OOP Style 🖼
- ***JavaSript*** has a prototype-based object orientation,
- ***Python*** has a class-based object orientation.

### Libraries 🗃
- ***JavaScript*** has React, Angular, Vue, and Express.js,
- ***Python*** has Django, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Pandas.

### Performance 💪🏿
- ***JavaScript*** is generally faster in web apps (V8 engine),
- ***Python*** is slower, but strong with optimized libraries.

### Community 🙆🏿‍♀️
- ***JavaScript*** is strong in web development,
- ***Python*** is strong in data science, AI, and research.
